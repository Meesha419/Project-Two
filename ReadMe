Project Proposal
COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress
(Kaggle)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress?select=country_vaccinations.csv
There are two CSV files used to extract, transform and load data.
	country vaccinations 
	country_vaccinations_by_manufacturer
from the two data sets we are going to find:
•	Which manufacturer made most/how many vaccines across the world 
•	Which vaccine is used most across the world 

ETL
Extract the data
	CSV to dataframes 
Transformation 
	Most recent date and filtered data
	Drop some of the columns that doesn’t include in the new Data frame (I:e: date etc.)
	New data frame there won’t be a date (it will be dropped)
		
Load
Combine data into one table (based on the country name/ Location, vaccine name etc…)
